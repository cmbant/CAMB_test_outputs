# CAM _test outputs

This repository stores expected and test run outputs for CAMB unit tests.

Each branch on cmbant/CAMB with a Travistests will compare results against results saved in the same-named branch here. 
After any travis test is complete, the outputs of the test run are also uploaded to a branch here called branch_travis, so the branch_travis
branches contain the history of test results (and diffs show changed between test results).
